# Autonomous Cyber Defense Agents - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a multi-agent AI system for autonomous cybersecurity defense, consisting of three specialized agents:

1. **Hunter Agent**: Autonomously detects threats in network traffic and system logs using machine learning.
2. **Classifier Agent**: Classifies detected threats using LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation.
3. **Response Agent**: Executes appropriate response actions based on threat classifications.

The system operates in a simulated enterprise network environment with injected cyber attacks to demonstrate the agents' capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Threat Detection**: The Hunter Agent uses machine learning to detect threats in real-time.
2. **Dynamic Threat Classification**: The Classifier Agent uses LLMs and RAG to provide detailed threat classifications.
3. **Autonomous Response**: The Response Agent automatically executes appropriate response actions.
4. **Simulated Environment**: The system includes a realistic network simulation for testing and demonstration.
5. **Configurable Policies**: Response policies can be configured for different attack types and severity levels.

## Technical Implementation

- **Machine Learning**: The Hunter Agent uses a Random Forest classifier for threat detection.
- **LLMs**: The Classifier Agent uses LLMs for threat classification and context generation.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: The agents operate asynchronously and communicate through a shared memory space.
- **Containerization**: The system is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal and vertical scaling for handling increased load.

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance ML Models**: Improve the Hunter Agent's detection capabilities with more advanced ML techniques.
2. **Expand LLM Integration**: Enhance the Classifier Agent with more advanced LLM models and techniques.
3. **Add Visualization**: Develop a real-time dashboard for monitoring system activity.
4. **Implement Adversarial Training**: Train the agents against evasion attacks to improve robustness.
5. **Add Federated Learning**: Implement federated learning for distributed multi-agent updates.

## Conclusion

The Autonomous Cyber Defense Agents project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven cybersecurity defense. By combining machine learning, LLMs, and autonomous agents, the system provides a comprehensive solution for detecting, classifying, and responding to cyber threats in real-time.
