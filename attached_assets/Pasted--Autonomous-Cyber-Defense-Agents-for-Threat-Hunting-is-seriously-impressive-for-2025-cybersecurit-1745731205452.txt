"Autonomous Cyber Defense Agents for Threat Hunting" is seriously impressive for 2025 â€” cybersecurity + AI + multi-agent systems is a goldmine for recruiters.

Here's a full mini-proposal with problem statement, architecture diagram outline, implementation roadmap, and deliverables:

Autonomous Cyber Defense Agents for Threat Hunting


---

Problem Statement:

Traditional cybersecurity defense relies heavily on human analysts for threat detection and response, leading to slow reaction times and human error. With the increase in sophisticated attacks (e.g., APTs, ransomware), there is a critical need for autonomous AI agents that can hunt, detect, classify, and mitigate cyber threats in real time without human intervention.

This project proposes a multi-agent AI system capable of:

Autonomous anomaly detection (network, log, file system).

Dynamic threat classification (using LLMs + RAG from threat feeds).

Self-healing response (patching, isolating nodes, resetting access).

Agent Roles:

Threat Hunter: Continuously scans and flags anomalies.

Classifier: Queries LLM + RAG to classify and prioritize threats.

Response: Takes autonomous mitigation actions (block IP, patch software, isolate device).

Implementation Steps:

Phase 1: Environment Setup

Simulate a small enterprise network using Docker or Kubernetes.

Inject benign traffic and realistic attack scenarios (SQLi, ransomware, phishing).


Phase 2: Threat Hunter Agent

Train an RL agent to detect deviations in traffic patterns, file changes, login anomalies.


Phase 3: Threat Classifier Agent

Fine-tune an LLM with threat intel data (CVE lists, MITRE ATT&CK framework).

Use retrieval-augmented techniques to get the latest threat signatures.


Phase 4: Response Agent

Map detected and classified threats to optimal defense actions.

Train using Reinforcement Learning (reward = minimized damage, fast recovery).


Phase 5: Communication Protocols

Agents communicate asynchronously using message queues or shared memory.


Phase 6: Evaluation

Measure detection rate, false positive/negative rates, time-to-mitigation.



---

Key Challenges & Considerations:

Realism of Simulated Attacks: Simulated attacks must be close to real-world threats.

Balancing Autonomy and Safety: Response agent must avoid overreacting (e.g., shutting down whole systems).

Data Imbalance: Anomalous data is rare; requires synthetic generation.

Adversarial Robustness: System must handle evasion attempts by attackers.



---

Deliverables:

Source Code Repository (well-documented, modular).

System Architecture Document (with diagrams).

Agent Training Logs and Performance Metrics.

Demo Video: Autonomous detection + mitigation in action.

Optional Bonus: Web dashboard visualizing agent decisions in real time (using Streamlit/React).

Why This Will Seriously Impress in 2025:

Shows multi-agent autonomous systems mastery (future of AI workflows).

Hands-on with realistic cybersecurity threats (very practical knowledge).

Combines LLMs, RAG, Reinforcement Learning, and Simulated Networking.

Cross-domain expertise (AI + Security + Systems).
